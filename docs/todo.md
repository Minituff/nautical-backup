This project is not complete, and is still under active development. Below are a few examples of things we would like to add:

* [ ] Config file `yml`
    * Used in addition to enviornment variables to configure Nautical.
* [ ] Backup file exclusions
    * For example, you could exclude `*.log` file from only the Trilium container.
* [ ] Lifecycle hooks
    * Allow calling a script in the container that will about to be shutdown.
