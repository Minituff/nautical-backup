Docker Labels allow us to apply settings to Nautical on a per-container basis. Instead of applying [environment variables](./arguments.md), we can apply the label to the each container separately.

### How to add labels

Here are a few examples of how to add labels to a Docker container.
Remember, these labels can be added to any container <small> (other than Nautical itself).</small>

=== "Docker Compose Example 1"
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      # Service config ...
      labels:
        - "nautical-backup.enable=true"
        - "nautical-backup.stop-before-backup=true"
        - "nautical-backup.rsync-custom-args= " # Disable custom rsync args
    ```

=== "Docker Compose Example 2"
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      pihole:
        container_name: pihole
        image: pihole/pihole:latest
        ports:
          - "53:53/tcp"
          - "53:53/udp"
          - "80:80/tcp"
        volumes:
          - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
          - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
        labels:
          - "nautical-backup.enable=true"
          - "nautical-backup.stop-before-backup=true"
    ```

=== "Docker Run Example 1"
    ```bash
    docker run --name example-image \
    -l nautical-backup.enable=true \
    -l nautical-backup.stop-before-backup=true \
    my-image:latest
    ```

=== "Docker Run Example 2"
    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      --name pihole \
      -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp \
      -p 80:80 \
      -e TZ="America/Chicago" \
      -v "${PIHOLE_BASE}/etc-pihole:/etc/pihole" \
      -v "${PIHOLE_BASE}/etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d" \
      -l nautical-backup.enable=true \
      -l nautical-backup.stop-before-backup=true \
      pihole/pihole:latest
    ```

### Label vs Environment Variable Priority
If a container has an Environment Variable applied as well as a conflicting Label, then:
> The container Label takes priority over the global Nautical environment variable.

## Enable or Disable Nautical
This Docker label can be used to achieve 2 things:

1. Opt a container **OUT** of backup
1. Opt a container **IN** to a backup <small>(with the Nautical [Require Label](./arguments.md#require-label) environment variable set to `true`)</small>

> **Default If Missing**: true <small> (all containers will be enabled, unless [Require Label](./arguments.md#require-label) is set to `true`).</small>

```properties
nautical-backup.enable=true
```

=== "Example 1 (Opt out)"
    !!! note ""
        With the [Require Label](./arguments.md#require-label) environment variable *not set* or set to `false`.
        ```yaml
        services: # Example Service #1 config ...
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.enable=false"
        ```
        ```yaml
        services: # Example Service #2 config ...
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.enable=true"
        ```
        ```yaml
        services: # Example Service #3 config ...
          labels: 
            # No labels
        ```
        The results of this configuration would be:

        - [ ] Service 1 - *Skipped* since `nautical-backup.enable` was set to `false`
        - [x] Service 2 - *Backed up* since the label `nautical-backup.enable=true` was present
        - [x] Service 3 - *Backed up* since no `nautical-backup.enable=false` label was found
            - The [Require Label](./arguments.md#require-label) environment variable was either *not set* or set to `false` for this example


=== "Example 2 (Opt in)"
    !!! note ""
        With the [Require Label](./arguments.md#require-label) environment variable set to `true`
        ```yaml title=""
        services: # Example Service #1 config ...
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.enable=true"
        ```
        ```yaml
        services: # Example Service #2 config ...
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.enable=false"
        ```
        ```yaml
        services: # Example Service #3 config ...
          labels: 
            # No labels
        ```

        The results of this configuration would be:

        - [x] Service 1 - *Backed up* since the label `nautical-backup.enable=true` was present
        - [ ] Service 2 - *Skipped* since `nautical-backup.enable` was set to `false`
        - [ ] Service 3 - *Skipped* since no `nautical-backup.enable=true` label was found
        
<small>ðŸ”„ `nautical-backup.enable=false` is the same action as the [Skip Containers](./arguments.md#skip-containers) variable, but applied only to this container.</small>


## Stop Container Before Backup

With this label set to `false`, the container will not be stopped before performing a backup.

> **Default If Missing**: true <small> (container ^^will^^ be stopped before backup).</small>

```properties
nautical-backup.stop-before-backup=false
```

!!! warning "Not stopping containers can produce *corrupt* backups."
    Containers with databases--particularly SQL--need to be shutdown before backup.

    Only do this on containers you know for certain do not need to be shutdown before backup.

<small>ðŸ”„ This is a similar action to the [Skip Stopping Containers](./arguments.md#skip-stopping-containers) variable, but applied only to this container.</small>

## Groups
Use this label to have multiple containers stopped, backed up, and restarted at the same time.

This is useful for services that require multiple containers.

> **Default If Missing**: *none* <small> (no groups, will be handed independently)</small>

> **Format**: `<string>`  <small>(comma separated for multiple items)</small>

```properties
nautical-backup.group=group_name
```
=== "Example 1"
    !!! example ""
        
        In this example, we define two groups: `paperless` and `authentic`. 
        The `redis` container is shared between two groups and will be backed up both times.
        
        ```yaml
        paperless-ngx:
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.group=paperless"
        ```
        ```yaml
        redis:
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.group=paperless,authentic"
        
        ```
        ```yaml
        authentic-worker:
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.group=authentic"
        
        ```
        
=== "Example 2"
    !!! example ""

        In this example, the `authentic` folder is defined for all the containers used by Authentic.

        They do *not* need to be part of the same docker-compose file.

        ```yaml
        services:
          authentik-worker-1:
            labels:
              - "nautical-backup.group=authentic"
          authentik-postgresql-1:
            labels:
              - "nautical-backup.group=authentic"
          authentik-redis-1:
            labels:
              - "nautical-backup.group=authentic"
        ```


## Group Priority (Order)
When using the [Groups](#groups) feature, the Priority will allow you to control the order in which containers are started/stopped.

Containers within a group are backed up with the ==highest priority first==, in descending order.

> **Default If Missing**: *100*

> **Format**: `<integer>`

```properties
nautical-backup.group.<group_name>.priority=<integer>
```
=== "Example 1"
    !!! example ""
        * The backup order for the group `paperless` is: *paperless-ngx* <small>(105)</small> --> *redis*  <small>(90)</small>
        * The backup order for the group `authentic` is: *authentic-worker*  <small>(100/default)</small> --> *redis*  <small>(85)</small>
        
        ```yaml
        paperless-ngx:
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.group=paperless"
            - "nautical-backup.group.paperless.priority=105"
        ```
        ```yaml
        redis:
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.group=paperless,authentic"
            - "nautical-backup.group.paperless.priority=90"
            - "nautical-backup.group.authentic.priority=85"
        
        ```
        ```yaml
        authentic-worker:
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.group=authentic"
        
        ```
        
=== "Example 2"
    !!! example ""
        * The backup order for the group `authentic` is: *worker*  <small>(110)</small> --> *redis*  <small>(105)</small> --> *postgresql*  <small>(100)</small>

        ```yaml
        services:
          authentik-worker-1:
            labels:
              - "nautical-backup.group=authentic"
              - "nautical-backup.group.authentic.priority=110"
          authentik-postgresql-1:
            labels:
              - "nautical-backup.group=authentic"
              - "nautical-backup.group.authentic.priority=100"
          authentik-redis-1:
            labels:
              - "nautical-backup.group=authentic"
              - "nautical-backup.group.authentic.priority=105"
        ```

## Additional Folders
Use this label to backup more folders associated with the container.

The additional folders must either exist or be mounted into the `app/source` folder within Nautical.

> **Default If Missing**: *none* <small> (no additional folders)</small>

> **Format**: `<folder_name>`  <small>(comma separated for multiple items)</small>


```properties
nautical-backup.additional-folders=folder1,folder_name2
```

### When to backup additional folders?

Use this setting to decide if when the additional folders are backed up.

> **Default**: during

> **Options**: during, before, after

```properties
nautical-backup.additional-folders.when=after
```

- [x] **During** <small>(Default)</small> - Backup the additional folders while the parent container  is stopped. <small>(This is the safest option)</small>.
- [ ] **Before** -  Backup the additional folders *before* the parent container is stopped.
- [ ] **After** -  Backup the additional folders *after* the parent container is restarted.


=== "Example 1"
    !!! example ""
        
        In this example, the `service-additional` folder already exists withing the `source` directory, so no additional mount point is needed.
        
        ```yaml
        version: '3'
        services:
          # Service config ...
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.additional-folders=service-additional"
        
        ------8<------ "docker-compose-example-no-tooltips.yml:4:11"
        ```
        
=== "Example 2"
    !!! example ""

        In this example, the `service-additional` folder is mounted from a different directory on the host machine.

        Also, the additional folders are backed up *after* the service is restarted.

        ```yaml
        version: '3'
        services:
          # Service config ...
          labels:
            - "nautical-backup.additional-folders=service-additional"
            - "nautical-backup.additional-folders.when=after"
        
        ------8<------ "docker-compose-example-no-tooltips.yml:4:11"
              - /mnt/service-additional:/app/source/service-additional #(1)!
        ```

        1. Mount `service-additional` inside the `/app/source` directory in the container


!!! abstract "If the same folder is called out by the [Additional Folders](./arguments.md#additional-folders) variable and a service label--it will be backed up twice."

<small>ðŸ”„ This is the same action as the [Additional Folders](./arguments.md#additional-folders) variable, but applied only to this container.</small>

## Override Source Directory Name

Changes the source directory name that Nautical will look for.

By default, Nautical will look for the source directory that is the same name as the container name.

> **Default If Missing**: *empty* <small>(use container name)</small>

=== "Example 1"
    ```properties
    nautical-backup.override-source-dir=new_folder_name
    ```

=== "Example 2"
    To backup the container `Pi.Alert`, the source directory name must be named `Pi.Alert`, but we can use the override to allow a backup of the folder named `pialert`.
    ```properties
    nautical-backup.override-source-dir=pialert
    ```

<small>ðŸ”„ This is the same action as the [Override Source Directory](./arguments.md#override-source-directory) variable, but applied only to this container.</small>

## Override Destination Directory Name
Changes the destination/output directory name that Nautical will create during backups.

By default, Nautical will create destination directory that is the same name as the container name.

> **Default If Missing**: *empty* <small>(use container name)</small>

```properties
nautical-backup.override-destination-dir=new_folder_name
```

<small>ðŸ”„ This is the same action as the [Override Destination Directory](./arguments.md#override-destination-directory) variable, but applied only to this container.</small>

## Mirror Source Directory Name to Destination
Mirror the source folder name to the destination folder name. By default <small>(without any [overrides](#override-source-directory-name))</small>, this means both the `source` and `destination` folder names are the ^^same as the container name^^.

When using a [source directory override](#override-source-directory-name), then the `nautical-backup.keep_src_dir_name=true` setting<small> (which is the default) </small>will mean the destination directory will be the same as the source directory, without using a [destination directory overrides](#override-destination-directory-name).

If a [destination directory override](#override-destination-directory-name) is applied for a container, then the override ^^will^^ be used instead of mirroring the source name, regardless of the `KEEP_SRC_DIR_NAME` setting. 

> **Default If Missing**: true

```properties
nautical-backup.keep_src_dir_name=false
```

<small>ðŸ”„ This is the same action as the [Mirror Source Directory Name to Destination](./arguments.md#mirror-source-directory-name-to-destination) variable, but applied only to this container.</small>


## Execute Commands
Execute a command *before*, *after* or *during* backing up the container. This can be used to alert the service before shutdown and/or ensure the service came online correctly.

> **Default**: *empty* <small>(nothing will be done)</small>

> **FORMAT**: The entirety of a `command`


```properties
nautical-backup.exec.before=/config/prepare-for-backup.sh
nautical-backup.exec.after=curl -X POST 'http://192.168.1.21.com/do-something'
nautical-backup.exec.during=curl -X PATCH 'bing.com'
```

!!! tip "Remeber, these commands are exectuted by the Nautical-Backup container, not the child container."
    If you need to exectute commands inside the continer being backed up, see [lifecycle hooks](#lifecycle-hooks).

There are 3 moments when you can run a *command* <small>(You can use more than 1)</small>:

- [ ] **Before** - Run the command *before* the parent container is stopped.
- [ ] **After** -  Run the command *after* the parent container is restarted.
- [ ] **During** - Run the command while the parent container is stopped <small>(Before it is restarted)</small>.

------8<------ "exec_request_example.md"

<small>ðŸ”„ This is the same action as the [Execute Commands](./arguments.md#execute-commands-before-or-after-backup) variable, but applied only to this container.</small>

## Lifecycle Hooks
Lifecycle Hooks allow you to run a command ==*inside* the container that Nautical is backing up==.
This can be used to shutdown services and/or test for a successful restart.

> **Default**: *empty* <small>(no hooks)</small>

> **FORMAT**: [docker exec format](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec)

```properties
nautical-backup.lifecycle.before=echo 'Hello from the container'
nautical-backup.lifecycle.after=/bin/sh ./script.sh
```

!!! example "Test your lifecycle hooks"
    Before setting the label, it is a good idea to ensure it works first. Here is an example.

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container-name> echo 'Hello from the container'
    docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/sh ./script.sh
    ```

    **Remember:** `./script.sh` is inside the container itself, not within Nautical.

### Lifecycle Hook Timeouts

The default timeout for all lifecycle hooks is `60 seconds` <small>(60s)</small>.
We can change this using another label.


> **Default**: 60s

> **FORMAT**: [timeout command format](https://ss64.com/bash/timeout.html)
<small>(`s` for seconds, `m` for minutes `h` for hours, `d` for days, `0` to disable)</small>

```properties
nautical-backup.lifecycle.before.timeout=1m
nautical-backup.lifecycle.after.timeout=0 # Disable timeout completely
```

???+ tip "Test your timeouts"
    You can test out the command timeout using the following format:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container-name> timeout 0 echo 'Hello from the other side'
    docker exec -it <container-name> timeout 1m /bin/sh ./script.sh
    ```

## Use Default rsync Arguments
Use the default `rsync` arguments `-raq` <small>(recursive, archive, quiet)</small>

Useful when using [Custom rsync Arguments](#custom-rsync-arguments)

> **Default**: *none* <small>(use global setting)</small>

```properties
nautical-backup.use-default-rsync-args=false
```

!!! note "This label will *override* the global setting applied through [Environment Variables](./arguments.md)"
    * A value of `true` will use the default rsync arguments regardless of the global setting.
    * A value of `false` will ^^**not**^^ use the default rsync arguments regardless of the global setting.
    * Not setting the label value will use the [global setting](./arguments.md#custom-rsync-arguments)

<small>ðŸ”„ Not setting a label is the same action as the [Use Default rsync Arguments](./arguments.md#use-default-rsync-arguments) variable, but applied only to this container.</small>

## Custom rsync Arguments
Apply custom `rsync` args <small>(in addition to the [default](#use-default-rsync-arguments) args)</small>

> **Default**: *empty* <small>(use global setting)</small>

```properties
nautical-backup.rsync-custom-args=--exclude='*.log' --exclude='*.txt'
```

!!! note "This label will *override* the global setting applied through [Environment Variables](./arguments.md)"
    * *Any value* will override the global rsync arguments configured through [global settings](./arguments.md#custom-rsync-arguments).
    * A value of <small>(space)</small> `"nautical-backup.rsync-custom-args= "` will ^^cancel^^ any [global setting](./arguments.md#custom-rsync-arguments) for this container only.
    * Not setting the label value will use the [global setting](./arguments.md#custom-rsync-arguments).

<small>ðŸ”„ Not setting a label is the same action as the [Custom rsync Arguments](./arguments.md#custom-rsync-arguments) variable, but applied only to this container.</small>
